1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

- The datetime package was quite helpful in sorting payers by their timestamp. 
- Furthermore, I specifically chose the datetime package in order to exploit its in-built strptime() function to parse through a specified date-time format and create a comparable datetime object.

- I chose to use the csv library because of its ability to parse through csv file, split across ",", and creating a dictionary with the column names as the keys
- The sys library only served the single purpose of extracting command line arguments

- Python supports Object-Oriented Programming which proved to be useful in my decision to create Payer objects

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

Advantages:
a. Using objects over tuples allows us to modify values unlike tuples which are immutable
b. Better over a list of lists because of easier readability
c. My code approach will be able to read and store a large range of payers unlike an approach that uses lists to store each payer's attributes

Disadvantages:
a. Does not check if current list of payers will be enough to match the user's spending
b.
c.
