# Fetch-SWE
## Description
##### Fetch users have reward points in their accounts from owing to transactions pertaining to certain payers. While the particulars of these transactions are abstracted from the user, the accounting team ensures that these points are spent in the order of the transaction timestamp.
##### The Fetch-SWE program is intended to parse and collect data from a csv file containing a list of the before-mentioned transactions. After storing this data within custom user-defined object classes, the program runs a sorting algorithm to sort the transactions
## How to use the program?
##### Please follow the following format to compile and run the program:
```
python3 mycode.py <user's expenditure> <csv file>
```
